Super Tic-Tac-Toe

## What is SuperTicTacToe?

You take 9 TicTacToe games and arrange 
them in a 3x3 Grid. The rules are simple. 
Score 3 in a row (in one of the small games) 
and you'll win this cell. Win 3 small games 
in a row and you'll win SuperTicTacToe.

## Inspiration
I first learned about SuperTicTacToe on 
the vsauce youtube channel and had to try.

But because playing on paper is boring and stuff, 
I had to create an online version.

## I encountered a problem / bug / have a wish / ...
Open an issue, write some code, fix them yourselves.

I don't know how much time i'll invest in SuperT3, 
as this was written in around 3 hours on a sunday evening.

If you want a specific feature or improve it - go for it.
